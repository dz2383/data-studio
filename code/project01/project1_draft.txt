1.A paragraph or two about the work you've done (data sourcing, data cleaning, etc)

I scraped the yelp.com to get the names of restaurants, area of restaurants, and prices an ratings of restaurant.
Then, I categorized my data based on 'area' and get the mean of rating and the highest rating and lowest rating of each area.



2.A paragraph or two about your findings

Based on those limited data, I assume that East Village has better Japanese restaurants.


3.A list of additional "nice to have" improvements - this can be other graphics, improvements on your existing graphics, or further data analysis.

I should try to get more data from the yelp. Maybe 10 or 20 pages.
